# Gaussian-Mixture-Models
In this project I have implemented Expectation Maximization Algorithm (ALgorithm 38, Available: http://ciml.info/dl/v0_99/ciml-v0_99-ch16.pdf) to classify the given 2D data points into their corresponding gaussian clusters. 

It was a univariate distribution with means-0,5,10 respectively of each cluster.

I used Scikitlearn library for loss and accuracy measures and matplotlib library for accuracy graphs. For data visualization of GMM data-points I used stats package available in the SciPy library.
